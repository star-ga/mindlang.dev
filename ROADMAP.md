# Roadmap

## What's New
- **Naestro AutoAgent Engine (AAE)** — deterministic workflow compiler that converts natural-language descriptions into validated workflow graphs with auto-generated agents, tool-call graph assembly, error-aware patching, and policy-safe replay.
- **Naestro Context Engine (NCE)** — ingestion pipeline for URLs/PDFs/GitHub repos supporting semantic chunking, deduplication, multi-source context windows, and domain safety filtering, enabling DeepMind-style “no tools, no scraper” context loading.

## Milestones
- R7-PR4 introduces documentation and runtime scaffolding for AAE and NCE to align orchestration with deterministic replay requirements.
