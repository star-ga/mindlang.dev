    <h1>Community</h1>
    <p>
      MIND is still early, but the ecosystem is designed to be open, reviewable, and shaped by contributors.
      There are a few ways to get involved right now.
    </p>

    <h2>Discuss and report issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open compiler issues in <a href="https://github.com/cputer/mind/issues">cputer/mind · Issues</a>.</li>
      <li>File spec / design issues in <a href="https://github.com/cputer/mind-spec/issues">cputer/mind-spec · Issues</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Propose changes</h2>
    <p>
      Larger language or runtime changes should go through the RFC process, documented in
      the <a href="https://github.com/cputer/mind-spec">mind-spec</a> repository.
    </p>

    <h2>Real-time channels</h2>
    <p>
      A dedicated chat (e.g. Discord or similar) will be announced once the project reaches the next milestone.
      Until then, GitHub remains the primary place for coordination.
