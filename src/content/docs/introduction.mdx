# Welcome to MIND

MIND (Machine Intelligence Native Design) is a systems programming language for AI development.

## Key Features

- **Native Tensor Operations**: First-class support for tensors.
- **Differentiable Programming**: Built-in automatic differentiation.
- **Hardware Agnostic**: Run on CPU, GPU, and TPUs seamlessly.

## Code Example

```mind
fn main() {
    let t = tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
    print(t * 2.0);
}
```

This is a **bold** statement.
