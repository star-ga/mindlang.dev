title: MIND Ecosystem
description: Overview of the open-core MIND ecosystem across compiler, spec, and runtime offerings.

    <h1>Ecosystem</h1>
    <p>
      MIND is designed as an open-core ecosystem: the language and compiler are Apache 2.0,
      while certain runtime components and services are offered commercially.
    </p>

    <div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(260px,1fr)); gap:1.5rem; margin-top:2rem;">
      <div>
        <h2>Compiler &amp; CLI</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/cputer/mind"><code>cputer/mind</code></a></p>
        <p>Rust implementation of the MIND language, tensor/autodiff engine, IR, MLIR export, and optional CPU / MLIR execution backends.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Language spec</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/cputer/mind-spec"><code>cputer/mind-spec</code></a></p>
        <p>Authoritative MIND specification, design documents, and RFCs. Mirrored into this site under <a href="/docs/">/docs</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Runtime extensions</h2>
        <p><code>cputer/mind-runtime</code> (internal/private)</p>
        <p>Proprietary runtime extensions and services that build on the Apache 2.0 Community Edition. Licensed under STARGA’s commercial terms.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:2rem;">
      The intent is simple: you can read, modify, and ship the compiler and spec under Apache 2.0,
      while opting into commercial runtime and cloud offerings when you need them.
    </p>
